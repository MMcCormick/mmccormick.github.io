I think each of us begins life with the strength to be the only person
alive.

When we're born, we know close to nothing. We act on instinct. We
eventually start to fight for survival because it is what we have been
genetically programmed to do. We attempt to keep on living because,
well, that seems like a pretty good idea, and our parents are usually on
board.

If you were the only person alive, on a big deserted but well-stocked
island for example (with invisible baby-feeding robots?), you *might*
just survive. Just follow me down the rabbit hole here. You wouldn't
learn language, but you'd *struggle.* And I believe you'd try to find
*meaning* in that struggle.

In that life, you'd be important.

You'd be the only person alive. You'd wonder what dirt was made out of,
you'd realize that you were more intelligent than any of the other
things in (your) existence. That would be heavy. Your life would be
heavy.

In our interconnected lives, we realize how many other people exist. How
many have come before us. How many will come after us, if someone
figures out a way to generate clean water and stop WWIII from breaking
out. The point is, whether you pinpoint the start-date as
**Galileo-era** ("I figured it out") or **NASA-era** ("we all figured it
out"), mankind has had to start *dealing* with the fact that we are not
the center of the universe. Being *aware* of that fact is not enough. We
are just clumps of flesh standing on a lump of rock orbiting a lamp of
gas in the middle of NOWHERE (or NOWHICH, you string theory nerds), and
that, my friends, is just that.

It makes me feel insignificant. The more I learn about existence, the
more I realize how little effect I will really have on a grand scale.
But which scale matters? Would a completely isolated me feel the same
way?

Is my life "better" than it would be if I lived my whole (short) life
alone? I use quotes because the concept of "better" is one introduced by
society. It's one that's subjective. Perhaps the real question is, how
would I be different?

What would completely-isolated me be like? In studying him, would we
finally learn the differences between our nature and nurture? Where are
the Bubble Boys and Mowgli's who will answer my existential questions?
Anyone having a baby and up for a Truman-Show-type situation? No?
