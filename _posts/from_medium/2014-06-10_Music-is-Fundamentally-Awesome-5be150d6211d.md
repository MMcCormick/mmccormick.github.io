When I was really young, my dad and I were driving home from school. I
turned to him and said something along the lines of "wouldn't the world
be a lot worse without music?"

"Yeah, Matt, I think it would," he replied (paraphrased). He wasn't
humoring me. In fact, it seemed to strike him as a little bit deep.

This may not sound like all that much of a revelation. At the time,
though, it seemed to me that it would be very easy for music not to
exist. In fact, it still seems that way. Humans would simply interpret
melodic lines as changes in pitch, and nothing more. Consonant and
dissonant harmonies alike would be regular old sounds, with no
particular emotional connotation. Beethoven's Fifth would sound like an
active construction site.

If I may philosophically stretch this anecdote even further, I think I
was getting at a fairly important part of my world view; that good
things must be appreciated, regardless of how accessible they are in our
culture. These days, we have millions of songs at our fingertips, and
it's natural for us to take any particular piece of music for granted.

Frankly, our internet-globalized culture can sometimes lead to a lot of
cynicism. Nearly everything (including music) is judged on a global
stage against similar things. It's odd to think that if you didn't have
millions of songs to compare to the current track on your iWhatever, you
might simply have to judge the song on its merits.

So every once in a while, I like to remind myself that music is
**fundamentally** awesome. I shouldn't have to compare music to other
music if I don't want to. I can just take it as-is, not put it in a
genre, and compare it to silence.
