When you boil it down, almost every college student shares their
experience with many other talented youths at their intellectual level.
Sure, you've been taught not to compare your intelligence to others'.
People get offended. Probably you.

Honestly, within this small segment of
students-of-similar-intellects-and-probably-interests, is there any
accurate measure of *overall* intelligence? I'd say this kind of
judgment is meaningless and mostly based on ego, and I probably would
have said it while I was in school. But would I have said that about
**creativity?**

Before I go on, let me just say that I'm not using a narrow definition
of "creativity"; I'm not just talking about the "creatives" (musicians,
visual artists, etc). The best entrepreneurs are creative. The best
engineers are creative. When you think about the definition of
"creative", be creative.

I think we can agree that colleges attract similar students. I'm leaving
this vague, but it seems self-evident; colleges attract students who are
similar in certain ways for the same reasons that they have brands,
ideals, and admissions offices.

The scary thing is the **NUMBER** of other kids who are about as
talented is you are! Yes, it motivates you, but it can also crush you.
You observe, you reflect, you create, but the process and the constant
comparison can also beat you senseless. There's always someone doing
something you're not.

Looking back, I couldn't have asked for a better college experience. I
got opportunities some people would kill for. But that's not what was
going through my self-critical head. I was thinking about how
disappointing it was that I couldn't do plays as well as a cappella, or
how the other music majors had done so many more ensembles. I was
thinking about how much work I needed to do, or how I should really go
to that party, or much I needed to practice that thing for the
[Bubs](http://www.bubs.com/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="http://www.bubs.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

Did I create? Sure. I wrote a song or a lyric here or there. Girls
occasionally made me fall in love with them, and when I got back up from
that fall, I usually had to write something to dust myself off. But did
I promote it? Did I share it with friends? Was I proud of my individual
spark?

Nope.

People like to think that there is a strong correlation between
attending a "good" school and "success". On paper, they're right, and
many of the world's leaders went to top-tier colleges blah blah blah.
But did those world leaders do that *because* they went to college? Not
everyone who goes to college becomes great. Is there chance that they
are great *in spite* of college?

Is there a statistic for these "others"? Are there some who lose sight
of their creativity in a comparative college experience? Is that
entirely their fault? Are the awful politicians and underhanded lawyers
of today simply kids who thought they weren't good enough to follow
their passions? Is it really so easy to "switch majors" to something
new, surrounded by people light-years ahead of you?

I'm not trying to put down college as an idea overall; there are plenty
of others trying to do that, and frankly I disagree. It was the best
four years of my life, and I grew immensely as a person.

Still, let's not accept the status quo simply because it's great. We are
quick to recognize the benefits of the college system, but let's also
recognize the negatives:

Comparison can kill creativity, and there are classes for that.
