This is very well written, and I agree. I spent over a year working full
time (bootstrapping) toward a product like what you describe. During
that time, we discovered some interesting competition, such as
[http://getprismatic.com](http://getprismatic.com/home){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="http://getprismatic.com/home"
rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"}. Have you heard of it?
