The phrase **"do one thing, and do it well"** has a lot of variations.
In trying to find the right variation to use, I actually decided that
letting you pick your own was fine. It's not the phrase that I'm trying
to disagree with, it's the mental attitude.

Ironically, in googling the phrase "do one thing, and do it well", I
found [Google's
Philosophy](http://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="http://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, which I will now use as an example
(retroactively, after having written half of what follows):

> We first wrote these "10 things" when Google was just a few years old.
> From time to time we revisit this list to see if it still holds true.
> We hope it does---and you can hold us to that.

Well, you're in luck, Google, because I happened to already be writing a
blog article about #2.

> 2\. It's best to do one thing really, really well.

> We do search. With one of the world's largest research groups focused
> exclusively on solving search problems, we know what we do well, and

Okay Google, quick update. You're a multibillion dollar company. You
have tons of my private data, you have tons of my public data, and you
index the whole internet. Google X probably spends more than most
companies do, on stuff that doesn't even make you money yet. So unless
you count **"technology"** as your **"one thing"**, I'd say you're doing
a whole lot more than one thing well. And if you take out the "one" from
that phrase, you're just saying that "it's best to do things well".
Which... I... agree with?

So let's bring things back to the personal. Sure, if you need to become
great at something, and you don't care about balance, see how long you
can do just one thing. I've tried it. It drives me insane.

Me being insane isn't bad for everyone, though. It's not hard to see how
some people might benefit from other people working only on one thing
(cough Google execs) or working 80 hours a week (cough finance).

To me, the saying "do one thing, and do it well" sounds like defeatism.
It's not about doing something well, it's about *not getting
distracted*. It's about not trusting yourself to manage your own time.
In that light, the phrase sounds a lot like "be a cog in a machine"

> "Now, wait a minute, there, Matt. Not everyone feels like a cog in a
> machine simply because they've dedicated their life to one thing."

Well, anonymous and convenient voice, you're absolutely right. All I'm
saying is that **some** of the greats (pick your own) devoted all their
time to one thing, and **some** of the greats were effing Einstein.

Plus, when it comes down to it, I'd much rather face the apocalypse with
10 Jacks of All Trades than 100 Mikes of Very Specific Things.

...unless I was the dictator, but that's a different... well,
actually...
