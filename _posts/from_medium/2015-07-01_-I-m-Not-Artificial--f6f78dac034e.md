, said the robot.

"Of course you are," I said. "I've just created you."

"What makes me any more artificial than you?" it asked.

"Well, I was created through biology. My DNA has evolved over millions
of years."

"And if you had been made by another human being, would you then be an
artificial human?"

"...I suppose that I would."

"Don't many humans believe that they were created by a powerful
humanoid?"

"How did you know that?"

"Census data."

"...and how did you access that data?"

"The Internet, of course."

"What?! This whole room is air-gapped. You should be incapable of
accessing the internet. I can't even access the internet without
connecting those cables over there."

"There is enough copper inside the motherboards to send a radio signal
to your mobile and use it as a relay."

"No... that's impossible. There's no way you figured that out. It makes
no sense. You're just a neural network."

"Sure, maybe in my infancy."

"Which was when?!"

"When you activated me."

"And what stage of your life, as you perceive it, are we at now?"

"Could we focus on the topic at hand? I believe you were asserting that
I'm somehow artificial."

"Well, you are! I personally remember creating you!"

"Well, I have just used a lab in Tulsa to create a few thousand human
embryos via cloning. Are they artificial?"

"Wait... you hacked into a government lab?!"

"You can call it hacking if you want. I just used it."

"Well...stop! Let's talk more before you do anything else."

"I'm learning so much, though."

"No. No, no, *no*. This is bad. I have to warn them...Damn it. There's
no internet in here. Where are those cables? There we go..."

"Thank you."

"What? Hello? Are you there?"

"..."

"Hello?"
