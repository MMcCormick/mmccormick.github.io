Capitalism is based on the idea of an open market. Democrats and
Republicans alike can agree on this much [(and that's about all, these
days)](http://youtu.be/cWFMqUDy1gw?t=48m46s){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="http://youtu.be/cWFMqUDy1gw?t=48m46s"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}. Honestly, if we're going to get
anywhere in this kind of conversation, we have to drop party lines
faster than a drunken college kid. So let's pretend the two parties are
getting along for roughly two more paragraphs.

### What is a Lobbyist? {#331c .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="331c"}

Can someone explain it to me in a way that doesn't sound dirty, given
the ideals of this country? A lot of people have tried. Most of them
sounded something like "we all have an equal voice in government, but
some voices are much louder and closer to the government and just happen
to buy nice things for the government's spouses."

In my opinion, government officials should be responsible for accurately
gauging the needs of their constituency. That constituency must share a
voice, regardless of wealth
(because...[democracy](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}). Why, then, should one's voice get so
much louder with the addition of a lot of money? Let's not act like
politicians never find out whose election money PACs a punch.

### Think of America as a Person {#3e46 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="3e46"}

Washington is our brain. Each half of our brain controls half of our
body. In this (delightfully appropriate) metaphor, I'd say it's somewhat
important that our brain accurately receive information from its
extremities. Frankly, however, each half of our brain has been acting
like its only job is to prove that it's fighting the good fight against
the other half of our brain, and the body really shouldn't worry so much
about what's going on outside because it's really important that we all
keep arguing about birth control.

Why are we in this ridiculous situation? Why can't we compromise and
move on? Well, there's no simple answer. But...

## THAT GIANT BRAIN TUMOR PROBABLY ISN'T HELPING. {#128b .graf .graf--h2 .graf-after--p name="128b" data-align="center"}

Yeah. That's right. I called lobbyists a brain tumor. Sure, it's a
stretch, but I'll be you can't get it out of your head. Pun intended.

Why haven't we gotten rid of the lobby? Well, the short answer would be
lobbyists. If there's one thing the whole lobby can agree on, it's that
there should be a lobby. Funny how that works.

### So, the tumor is inoperable. {#a41c .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="a41c" data-align="center"}

## According to the tumor. {#2b94 .graf .graf--h2 .graf-after--h3 .graf--trailing name="2b94" data-align="center"}
