I am wearing a bracelet.

I'm not really one for jewelry, but the bracelet is not too showy.

I'm wearing the bracelet because I'm at a crossroads in my life, and the
bracelet makes me feel consistent.

I was wearing the bracelet yesterday. I will wear it tomorrow. I'm
wearing the bracelet even though it's four o'clock in the morning.

It won't come off, because it won't fit over my hand. That's part of why
I like it. I'm not losing this bracelet until it's broken or someone
cuts it off.

I know the bracelet won't be here forever. But that doesn't stop it from
being the most important bracelet I've ever had. And for the first time,
I'm actually trying to accept that.

Who is your bracelet?
