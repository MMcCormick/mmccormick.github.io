## Hi. {#3647 .graf .graf--h2 .graf-after--figure name="3647"}

My name is Matt C McCormick. I'm not sure if you know me, and if you do,
I'm not sure what from. You can probably figure it out [on my YouTube
page](http://youtube.com/mattcmccormick){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="http://youtube.com/mattcmccormick"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}. Anyway, today I'm going to talk about
[All Out](http://facebook.com/alloutma){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="http://facebook.com/alloutma"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, a hip pop project created by me and
[Joe Skutnik](http://youtube.com/joeskutnikmusic){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="http://youtube.com/joeskutnikmusic"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} in 2008.

### **Artists Complain About Spotify** {#cb72 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="cb72"}

It's annoying. I get annoyed with artists who do it, and I'm *one of
them*. In fact, I'm about to annoy us both a whole bunch. Still, I think
I'm somewhat justified:

If you missed the two huge charts right above this, take another look.
How did you miss those? They're huge. FINE, I'll lay it out for you:

Bummer. And I was all excited about this "Internet" thing.

<figcaption>“Lights” by All Out</figcaption>
</figure>

If you've heard of my band [All
Out](http://alloutma.com){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="http://alloutma.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, it's
probably because of [Lights](http://bit.ly/alloutlights){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="http://bit.ly/alloutlights" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}. Lights makes up a lot of our play; about 56% of
streams and 54% of sales. Seriously. My working theory is that there are
a few contributing factors: quality of the music video thanks to [Eric
Nichols](http://ericnichols.us){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="http://ericnichols.us" rel="noopener" target="_blank"},
timing with [The Sing
Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wldcHwwRHKg){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wldcHwwRHKg" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}, and resulting virality.

data-width="1390" data-height="1600" />
<figcaption>All Out’s stream and sales, per song</figcaption>
</figure>

Did you notice that the versions of Lights with 50%+ flip flop between
charts? There are a few reasons for this:

1.  [When we released the [Lights music
    video](http://bit.ly/alloutlights){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor data-href="http://bit.ly/alloutlights"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, which went viral, iTunes was still
    dominating Spotify in the US. Therefore, the video description links
    to iTunes.]{#a4df}
2.  [Spotify [has both our
    albums](https://play.spotify.com/artist/3Q9iaulvh7rGoY0H56dXKA){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor
    data-href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/3Q9iaulvh7rGoY0H56dXKA"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, but not the [single version of
    Lights](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/lights/id340650399){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor
    data-href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/lights/id340650399"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, which is featured in the music
    video. People looking for the song find the album version, which
    features [XV](https://twitter.com/XtotheV){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/XtotheV"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank"} (probably my favorite collab verse
    ever).]{#2c21}

Clearly, regardless of platform, Lights remains our biggest song. iTunes
is kind of like a control test for Spotify (or vice versa). Ockham's
Razor says the simplest explanation (with the fewest assumptions) is
often the best: **Lights is our best song, pretty much everyone agrees,
and that's that.** So if that's the case, the pie charts seem like
pretty compelling evidence that we have a single-driven culture... and
Spotify sort of a double-whammy:

> People aren't buying your album, they're streaming your single

This is essentially good for playback, and bad for album sales money.
I'll go a little deeper in a second, but first:

### Concessions of a Dangerous Mind {#6424 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="6424"}

**Look, I get it.** I use Spotify every day. If I don't find something
on Spotify, I'm not going to go buy it on iTunes. Then I'd own it, but
I'd have to manage two music apps on my phone and computer. That *might*
be worth it if half of my collection were in iTunes, but I have enough
Spotify inertia built up that I'm not going to take that leap of faith.

data-width="402" data-height="132" />
<figcaption>All Out’s Streams, May 2014</figcaption>
</figure>

Personally, I don't feel bad for a second using Spotify, because I've
**lost a lot more money to streaming music than I've saved.**

**And yes, I know All Out isn't very active anymore.** But if *that's*
the issue, why have our streams tripled in the last year? You really
should have looked at those charts.

**Not QUITE all of All Out's profits have come from iTunes and
Spotify.** We distribute through a few other stores, as well. However,
those stores make up about 0.88% of total sales.

**And yes, I know that streams will always outstrip sales.** You only
have to buy a song once. A+ for basic math.

> The (impossible) question is... how many of those streams would have

### So... One of Your Songs is Popular. What's the Problem? {#7db1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="7db1"}

I'll tell you what the problem is, annoying voice that keeps
interrupting my blog posts. How did you even manage to get into a
subtitle? Besides, I never said there was a "problem", I just said
"Spotify robs me blind":

-   [**20 years ago,** if someone wanted to listen to a new single in
    their car, they bought the album, or got it from a friend.]{#9c1f}
-   [**0 years ago,** All Out has sold 21 albums online. That's not a
    joke. Of course, we also gave those away for free, but **people
    always continued to buy singles.**]{#a787}
-   [**10 years ago,** if someone wanted to listen to a new single in
    their car, they might buy it on iTunes, or get it from a friend (or
    pirate it).]{#fafc}
-   [**0 years ago,** I got \$0.71 for every song sold on iTunes. To get
    \$0.71 on **Spotify**, I need **159 streams.**]{#7392}
-   [**20 years ago,** did you listen to every album 159 times? Probably
    just your favorites, right?]{#8e4d}
-   [**10 years ago,** did you listen to every single 159 times?
    Probably just your favorites, right?]{#6666}
-   [**0 years ago,** did you listen to every single song 159 times?
    Probably just your favorites, right?]{#3e53}

Well, now it's all much simpler: you can stream just about anything
without the guilt of pirating. Unfortunately for artists, superfans just
aren't as common as regular fans; y*ou can listen to that song just
once, if you want*. Sure, the artist only ends up with \$0.004... but
hey, who's counting?

...I am, dammit. I don't want to appeal to the broadest possible
audience at \$0.004 per stream, or \$0.0002 per YouTube view (I made
that one up because it's based on CPM).
