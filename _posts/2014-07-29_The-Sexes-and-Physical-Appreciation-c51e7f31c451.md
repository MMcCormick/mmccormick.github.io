#### DOWN WITH FEMINISM. Just kidding. {#subtitle .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--h2 .graf--subtitle name="subtitle"}

I once dated a girl who felt I cared too much for her body, and not
enough for her personality. This caused me to do a lot of
self-examination. I felt (still feel) that I appreciated her qualities
genuinely, be they physical, mental, or somewhere in between. Still, for
*some* reason, that's how my actions made her feel, and I feel bad about
it to this day.

Now, obviously, communication is a two-way street. It's entirely
possible that she was sensitive to those things for reasons which had
nothing to do with me. But let's leave that aside for now, because she
can't speak for herself in my blog post, and I can.

Let's say for the sake of argument (and my self-esteem) that I'm not a
misogynist. In fact, let's use a generic "he" and "she" situation, one
in which you can swap the "he" for the "she" any time you'd like.

What if, instead of asking the question, "why does he have more
appreciation for my body than my mind?", she asked "why does he
**express** more appreciation for my body than my mind?"

This changes the conversation in an important way. We accept that
perhaps the answer is not just to do with **her**.

What's that phrase that's been drilled into our heads since birth? Oh
yeah: "Treat others the way you wish to be treated." Could it really be
that simple? Might he express more physical appreciation toward the
woman he's closest with because he, in fact, feels under-appreciated in
that way (and not necessarily by her alone)?

If you had to make a call right now, which would you say is the more
physically appreciated sex? Don't worry about what I'm implying, just go
with your gut.

I don't choose what I appreciate about someone. I simply appreciate. The
idea that I should have been able to change my own feelings tore me
apart for a while, and I'm leaving it behind.

With this much time to (over)think it, though, I've realized that I
don't **have** to change how I feel. I just have to change how I
communicate. You can't just Golden Rule someone into making you feel
better about yourself. It needs to start with you.

Well, screw it. If you don't feel beautiful (eat it, frat bros), talk
about it. No one's going to hate you. They're just going to disagree.

Moral of the story: I'll be replacing "you look so beautiful in that"
with "do these pants make me look fat?" Problem solved. Right?
