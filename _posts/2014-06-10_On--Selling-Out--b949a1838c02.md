The "sell out" --- we're all familiar with the concept. Defined
hurriedly and [without
reference](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, a "sell out" is someone who creates for
popularity, rather than for some higher purpose (self-expression,
religion, etc).

The problem with the "sell out" concept is that nearly every artist
wants their music (or, at least the good stuff) to be heard by as large
an audience as possible. If they find value in their work, they want to
share it. And making a hit record is probably the best way to get your
other music heard.

Now, it's not as if artists can (always) tell beforehand which song is
going to be that cheesy smash. Afterward, many probably have a "really?
THAT song got me huge?" kind of mentality. But I'd bet they still have
an inkling that they're writing something a little more mass-appeal and
a little less from-the-soul (we can argue whether those are opposing
ideas at another time).

And really, why grind for all those years if you aren't going to sieze
opportunity when it presents itself? Write the damn pop song. I mean,
you can *tell* me that if you were Jason Mraz, you wouldn't write "I'm
Yours". Or that if you were Hanson, you wouldn't write "MMMBop". But if
*I* were me, I probably wouldn't believe you.
