  I have over a decade of experience building production software across the full stack. I think architecturally, care about code quality, and optimize for long-term maintainability over quick fixes. Recently I've been deep in LLM integration — building extraction pipelines, interactive AI workflows, and agent systems — but my foundation is as a generalist who picks up new stacks quickly and ships reliable software. I value collaborative teams, clear communication, and sustainable engineering practices.
