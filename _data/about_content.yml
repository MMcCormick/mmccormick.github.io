  I have well over a decade of experience creating production grade software. I've worked on a wide range of projects, from video messaging platforms to AI-powered narrative adventures. I've also worked on at-scale applications passing millions of messages per day. I excel at learning new systems and developing creative solutions, with a strong foundation in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Python, and AI technologies.
