  I've worked on a wide range of projects, from AI-driven narrative adventures to legislative databases and video messaging platforms. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of AI and web development, and I'm always looking for new challenges. I excel at learning new systems and developing creative solutions, with a strong foundation in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Python, and AI technologies.
